/*To make practice with variables you should create what follows:

    a variable for your name
    a variable for your last name
    if you have a middle name, create a variable for it
a variable that will sum the first two variables into your full name, make sure there is a space in between name, middle name and last name.

    print on the console: hello, my name is [NAME HERE]. Make sure to use the variables!
    Save your age to a variable
    Save the current year to a variable
    Starting from this two information, print your birth year on the terminal, saving it to a variable.
    If you are uncomfortable sharing this info, you can come up with fake ones.
Use NodeJS in the terminal to see the outcome in the console
BONUS: try to run the code in the browser as well. Add a <script> tag at the end of an html <body> and check the browserâ€™s console for the result. */
